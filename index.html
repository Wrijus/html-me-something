                     <h2>What is a Geek</h2>

                     <p>The word geek is a slang term originally
                        used to describe eccentric or non-mainstream 
                        people, the word typically connotes an expert
                        or enthusiast or a person obsessed with a hobby 
                        or intellectual pursuit. The more mainstream and
                        urban meaning of geek is an outwardly normal
                        person who has taken the time to learn technical 
                        skills. Geeks have as normal a social life as anyone, 
                        and usually the only way to tell if someone is a geek 
                        is if they inform you of their skills.</p>

                     <h2>A Byte of My story</h2>
                     <img src="images/stl.jpg" style="width:250px;"/><img src="images/sega saturn.jpg"style="width:250px;"/><img src="images/star wars.jpg"style="width:240px;"/>
                     <p>I was born here in St. Louis Missouri. I have always loved 
                        tech and technology, I was recently trying to figure 
                        out when did it start. My first mind was with my Sega 
                        Dreamcast and it's ability to go on-line, but we are 
                        talking game systems it would have to be the Atari 
                        2600. In conversation with wife, she said “it was 
                        probably 1977” in bewilderment I asked why “77”, her 
                        answer was.....”STARWARS”, my reply was “HELL FRACKING 
                        YES.”</p>

                     <p>My foray into world of geek tech start with me taking 
                        small and broken electronic apart, then I became the 
                        reader of manuals so no VCR, around me, ever blinked 
                        12:00. Video Games, of course, was a fav past time of 
                        mine then and now. In school and friends homes, I got 
                        to play with real computers, my first was Apple Macintosh 
                        and Commodore computers, then PC's when Microsoft 
                        took-off. The first PC I owned, was one I built myself, 
                        where I did all my own maintenance, repairs and upgrades. 
                        Along the way I also pickup A/V tech ie: VCR's, TV's, 
                        audio system's, DVD/Blu ray's players, Lcd/Led tv's, 
                        and now streaming devices and home theater PC's.(Plex 
                        the one media server to rule them all)</p>

                    <p>Like most Geeks or how I like to call it “People with 
                       Geek tendencies”  we have a multitude of interests.</p>

                    <h2>The Output of it All</h2>
                    <p>Someone once said Geeks are awkward and socially 
                       inept, but if you give them something to socialize about 
                       we socialize the smeg out it ie: Comic Con, Dragon Con, 
                       Steampunk events, and Renaissance Festival. Which I 
                       “may” have been to one or two of these, so the Geek 
                       community is vast and varied in our media.</p>
